# Simple Data Exchanger

## **Introduction and Goals**

### **Requirements Overview**
<br />

#### **What is SDE?**

In order to allow Data Providers and Data Consumers to easily participate in relevant Use Cases, a service for low-effort data sharing was needed. The service would add a convenience layer around already established CX components, such as EDC and Digital Twin Registry, simplifying their use.
- SDE is short for **S**imple **D**ata **E**xchanger.
- It is a standalone service which can be self-hosted.
- It enables companies to provide their data in the Catena-X network via an EDC.
- Data is uploaded via CSV-files/Manual Entry/Json format.
- The SDE registers the data in the Digital Twin Registry and makes it accessible via an EDC.
- SDE also act as a Data Consumer.
- It is show the data offers from data provider.

<br />

#### **Essential Features**

- Compliance with Catena-X Guidelines.
- Parsing of CSV file/manual Entry for Parts and Relationships.
- Integration with Digital Twin registry.
- Utilization of EDC to provide data and consume data.

<br />

#### **Further key information**

- SDE is an **Open-Source reference implementation** allowing to provide & consume data within the Catena-X network using the Eclipse Data Space (EDC) Connector & Digital Twin Registry.
- It is **not** "the only" way to exchange data with the Catena-X network. It is meant only as one consistent example how EDC + Digital Twin registry APIs can be used end-to-end. Other applications may be developed and co-exist that fulfill a similar purpose.
- Is is **not** meant to fulfill "functional completeness" in the sense of satisfying each and every user group or use case.
- It primary targets companies with low IT skills, therefore it is a Simple Data Exchanger.

<br />

### **Quality Goals**

The following table describes the key quality objectives of SDE.

| Quality Goal                         | Motivation/description                                                                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integration into Catena-X Network    | The SDE is meant to help companies bringing their data to Catena-X. One key goal is to be integrated into the Catena-X network with all its services |
| CSV input files with clear structure | The input files used by SDE should be easy to understand by every company                                                                            |
| Lightweight service                  | The service should be as lightweight as possible to enable easy deployment.                                                                          |
| Docker Container                     | SDE should be deployable via Docker to make deployment as easy as possible                                                                           |
| Integrate EDC in Deployment          | Make SDE an all-in-one solution                                                                                                                      |

The quality scenarios detail these goals and serve to evaluate their achievement.

<br />
The SDE is divided into two components: Frontend and Backend. The frontend is very minimal with only the basic functionality.<br />
The backend is implemented in Java to ensure wide adoption following the Clean architecture principles.

<br /><img src="images/solution-strategy.jpeg" height="60%" width="60%" /><br /><br />

<br />

## **Building Block View**

SDE is a classic single tenant Web application that communicates with the backend api through REST.

Its having 2 components:

1. Frontend in React;
2. Backend in Java with SpringBoot;

<br /><br /><img src="images/building-block-view.png" height="60%" width="60%" /><br /><br />

| SubSystem     	| Short description                                                                                               	|
|---------------	|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| Frontend      	| Provide a friendly interface to the user to support the csv file upload or sub model creation                   	|
| Backend       	| Service that contains the REST api to support the Frontend and the execution pipeline to process the sub models 	|
| EDC           	| Eclipse data connector acting as data provider and data consumer to retrieve sub model's details                	|
| Digital Twins 	| Rest API that allows to register a sub model                                                                    	|

<br />

### **Interfaces or Apis**

SDE does not expose interfaces for other applications or components to call (i.e. no "external interfaces").

SDE does call interfaces of other components as by the picture above (i.e. of EDC, Digital Twin Registry).

There is a web interface between frontend and backend.<br /><br />

## **Deployment View**

<br />
In deployment we are using [ArgoCD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and Helm. The Helm configuration can be found in folder "helm" in respective repositories.

We have 2 applications on ArgoCD , one for frontend and one for backend. Both applications have auto-sync enabled.
